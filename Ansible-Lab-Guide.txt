## Import and start the base networking VM ##
Open “NOS-VM-Template.ova” with VirtualBox and import the VM
Give the VM a name and choose the location to store the VM locally
Edit the Virtual Disk Image file name for the VMDK if you want it to match the VM name (optional)
Select the checkbox to ‘Reinitialize the MAC address of all network cards’
Import and then go into settings --> network --> change the ‘Attached to:’ setting to “NAT”
Click on advanced and add a rule to forward port 2201 on host to the guest port 22
Start the VM
The VM will boot into a pre-install linux kernel called ONIE (Open Network Install Environment)

## Upload the Dell OS10 image to the VM ##
Use WinSCP to connect via SCP (not SFTP) to 127.0.0.1 on port 2201 with the username root (no password)
Upload the file ‘PKGS_OS10-Enterprise-10.4.0E.R1.56-installer-x86_64.bin’ from your local copy into the remote VM directory ‘/root’

## Install OS10 ##
Press enter and type ‘onie-discovery-stop’ (this stops the auto discovery boot process)
Run the following command on the VM console:
onie-nos-install /root/PKGS_OS10-Enterprise-10.4.0E.R1.56-installer-x86_64.bin
#OS10 should install itself, then reboot into a login prompt
#You will now be able to login to OS10 with username admin and password admin

## Build the Ansible mgmt server ##
Open a dos prompt and cd into the directory containing your files prepared earlier;
Vagrant up
# A new VM will be created in Virtualbox

## Configure the switch ##
Edit the OS10 SIM VM network settings to allow the two VMs to communicate
Edit the network ‘attached to:’ for Adapter 1 to be “Host-only Adapter”
Type the following commands in the OS10 VM console:

conf t
int mgmt. 1/1/1
no ip address dhcp
ip address 192.168.56.40/24
shut
no shut
exit
ip ssh server enable
ip ssh server kex diffie-helman-group1-sha1
ping 192.168.56.10 (confirm ping is successful)

# We now have a linux VM with Ansible installed and a Dell OS10 VM that are connected on the same network and can communicate with each other.

## Start to use Ansible ##
Use putty to ssh to 127.0.0.1 on port 2222 (remember, this is the port vagrant setup for the mgmt VM)
Edit /etc/ansible/hosts as follows;
[switch]
192.168.56.40
Run the following command to test that we can use Ansible to ping the switch
ansible all -m ping -k -u admin
Type ‘yes’ to accept the ssh key when asked
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml showver_os10.yaml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml getfacts_os10.yaml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml hostname_os10.yaml

## All done!!!!1
